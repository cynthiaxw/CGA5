// HOW TO BUILD     //
/////////////////////

Dependencies:

GLFW
If on Ubuntu you can run:
	sudo apt-get install libglfw3-dev libglfw3
Or download directly from: 
	https://www.opengl.org/discussion_boards/showthread.php/200108-Installing-glfw-on-Ubuntu-16-04


Makefile build commands:

make 
	Builds the project and creates directory for object files
make clean
	Deletes executable, object files and object directory

Note: This is designed for linux, however it may work on Mac OSX, while it is untested. For a more reliable version, download the xcode version.
